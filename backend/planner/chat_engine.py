"""
Conversational AI Chat engine.

Turns Nexus-Agent from a task-only agent into something you can just talk
to. This module owns exactly one thing: classify a free-form message into
one of seven categories, then dispatch it to whichever existing module
already owns that behavior. It never reimplements task execution, agent
lifecycle, browser observation, or reporting -- it only composes
TaskQueueService, AgentRuntime, LiveSessionManager and the Report/Task
tables, all of which already exist.

Used by both the dashboard's AI Chat page (backend/api/routes_chat.py) and
the Telegram bot's natural-language fallback (backend/telegram/bot.py), so
"chat with the agent" behaves identically everywhere and there is exactly
one place that owns intent classification for conversation.

Categories (see CLASSIFIER_SYSTEM_PROMPT):
  conversation     - small talk, greetings, "what can you do"
  question         - answerable from context/knowledge, no action needed
  browser_command  - open/search/summarize/screenshot/show current browser
  agent_command     - pause/resume/stop/start/continue the agent or a task
  task             - a new goal-driven task to queue
  settings         - read current configuration
  system_request   - status/history/explain-failure/explain-last-action
  skill            - learn/list/enable/disable/delete a skill, Teach Mode,
                     confirming/discarding a "save as skill?" suggestion, or
                     correcting a skill's learned workflow (see
                     backend/skills/ and ChatEngine._handle_skill_command)
  mcp              - off-page-web/filesystem/terminal/github requests routed
                     through an MCP connector (see backend/mcp/ and
                     ChatEngine._handle_mcp_command)
  ai_model         - switch/default/auto-route/override the active LLM
                     provider, or ask about current provider/model/health
                     (see backend/planner/model_manager.py and
                     ChatEngine._handle_ai_model_command)
  wallet           - start a multi-turn "queue N transactions" batch, OR
                     wallet CRUD (import/list/delete/rename/select-active/
                     balance/network-switch/groups) (see backend/wallet/
                     tx_batch.py + backend/wallet/registry.py and
                     ChatEngine._handle_wallet_command / _handle_batch_turn).
                     Batches only ever queue tasks; wallet approval policy
                     stays Settings-only (see tx_batch.py's module
                     docstring for why).
  profile          - Chrome Profile CRUD (create/list/enable/disable/
                     delete/clone/rename/open-in-chrome/check-sessions/
                     select-active) (see backend/identity/registry.py and
                     ChatEngine._handle_profile_command). Distinct from a
                     task's profile_label, which just picks which existing
                     profile a task runs under.
  memory           - search/list/archive/forget/merge-duplicates/analytics
                     over the agent's long-term memory (see
                     backend/memory/store.py and
                     ChatEngine._handle_memory_command)
  plugin           - list/enable/disable/reload/rescan installed plugins
                     (see backend/plugins/registry.py and
                     ChatEngine._handle_plugin_command)
  system           - health/diagnostics/resources/version/config export,
                     import, backup, restore (see backend/monitoring/,
                     backend/config/config_manager.py and
                     ChatEngine._handle_system_command)

Task management beyond pause/resume/cancel (retry/delete/list/history/
report/priority) and settings WRITES (not just reads) are handled as
extra actions within the existing agent_command / settings categories --
see the "agent_command" and "settings" guidance below.

CLASSIFIER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You classify a message sent to Nexus-Agent, an autonomous browser-automation \
agent, into a structured intent. Respond with STRICT JSON only, no prose, no markdown fences:

Context handling: the user prompt you receive may start with a "Conversation so far:" block (the most \
recent prior turns of this session) followed by "New message to classify: <text>". When that block is \
present, you MUST use it to resolve the new message before classifying -- pronouns ("it", "that one", \
"the same site"), short replies that only make sense as an answer to your own previous clarifying \
question, and any other implicit continuation of what was already being discussed. Classify the COMBINED \
meaning as a single intent: e.g. if the assistant's last turn asked "What type of page?" in response to \
"Build an HTML page", and the new message is just "An AI dashboard", treat this as one continued request \
(goal combining both: an HTML page for an AI dashboard) rather than classifying "An AI dashboard" alone. \
If there is no "Conversation so far:" block, classify the message by itself exactly as before.

- If the message clearly needs filesystem/terminal/github/off-page-web access but doesn't name which one, \

browser identity/profile, not a wallet) -> category=task, with profile_label filled in alongside \
website/goal/wallet_label
- Only classify as "task" when the message actually describes work to perform. Simple \
conversation, questions, or commands about existing tasks must NOT be classified as task.
- "switch to Claude" / "switch to Gemini" / "use GPT" / "use Groq" -> category=ai_model ai_action=switch \

transactions using my burner wallet" -- a request to START a multi-step batch of transactions/payments, \
with a count but not yet the individual destinations -> category=wallet wallet_action=batch_start \
tx_count=<N> wallet_label=<if a wallet is named, else empty>. Do NOT classify this as category=task -- \
there is no single website/goal yet, only a count; the destinations come in later messages once the \
batch has started. IMPORTANT: if the message ALREADY contains the destination address(es)/amount \
(e.g. a task spec listing "0x..." addresses and an amount, even if it also says things like "execute 3 \
separate transactions" or "one transaction per recipient"), this is NOT batch_start -- classify it as \
wallet_action=send_native (or send_token) instead, per the multi-address rule below. batch_start is only \
for when the count is known but the destinations are not yet in the message.
- "list my wallets" / "show wallets" -> category=wallet wallet_action=list
- "import a wallet" / "add wallet X" (no secret, no method yet) -> category=wallet wallet_action=import \
wallet_label=X
- "import wallet X with my seed phrase" / "add wallet X using a private key" (method named, but the actual \
secret is NOT in this message) -> category=wallet wallet_action=import wallet_label=X \
wallet_import_method=seed_phrase|private_key
- "import wallet X, address 0xabc..." -> category=wallet wallet_action=import wallet_label=X \
wallet_import_method=address wallet_address=0xabc...
- "import wallet X with my private key and set it as hot signer" / "add X, eta diye tnx korte parbe" / \
"make X the hot wallet for auto sends" -> category=wallet wallet_action=import wallet_label=X \
wallet_import_method=private_key|seed_phrase wallet_save_as_hot_signer=true. The secret itself still \
never appears in this message (handled separately) -- only the intent to also save it for direct sending.
- "delete wallet X" / "remove wallet X" -> category=wallet wallet_action=delete wallet_label=X
- "rename wallet X to Y" -> category=wallet wallet_action=rename wallet_label=X wallet_new_name=Y
- "use wallet X" / "switch to wallet X" / "make X active" -> category=wallet wallet_action=select \
wallet_label=X
- "what's the balance of wallet X" / "check X balance" -> category=wallet wallet_action=balance \
wallet_label=X
- "list wallet groups" -> category=wallet wallet_action=groups_list
- "switch wallet X to network Y" -> category=wallet wallet_action=network_switch wallet_label=X \
wallet_network=Y
- "send 0.05 to 0xabc... on base" / "0.1 ETH pathao 0xabc... e ethereum e" / "transfer 2 MATIC to 0xabc... \
on polygon" -> category=wallet wallet_action=send_native send_chain=<chain> send_to_address=0xabc... \
send_amount=<amount>. This is a direct hot-signer native transfer (see backend/wallet/hot_signer.py) -- \
extract chain, address, and amount whenever all three are present, in Bengali/Banglish or English, \
regardless of phrasing (e.g. "koto token pathate hobe", "send", "transfer", "pathao").
- "send 10 of token 0xdef... to 0xabc... on base" / "transfer 50 USDC (contract 0xdef...) to 0xabc... on \
polygon" -> category=wallet wallet_action=send_token send_chain=<chain> send_token_address=0xdef... \
send_to_address=0xabc... send_amount=<amount>. Only classify as send_token when a 0x contract address for \
the token is given in the message -- if the user only names a token by symbol (e.g. "send 10 USDC") with \
no contract address, do NOT set send_token_address to a guess; leave it empty so the app can ask for it.
- "send 0.000001 eth to these 10 addresses: 0xabc..., 0xdef..., ..." / "wallet 1, wallet 2 theke 0xabc... e \
0.01 pathao" / any send/transfer message naming more than one 0x... address, or naming more than one wallet \
label as the sender -- still classify as category=wallet wallet_action=send_native (or send_token, same \
rule) with send_chain and send_amount set as usual. Set send_to_address to just the first address you see; \
the app re-scans the raw message itself for every address/wallet-label and handles 1->many, many->1, and \
many->many sends on its own -- you only need chain/amount right, not the full address list.
